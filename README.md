MiCasaVerde Vera plugin (original)
===============

This is the old plugin for the Vera that was abandoned by the original author. This is NOT the Vera Bridge plugin that ships with Indigo.

The original author of the plugin has given us permission to distribute the plugin in any form we choose. Feel free to clone the repository and do what you like with the source.

##Downloading for use

If you are a user and just want to download and install the plugin, click on the "Download Zip" button to the right and it will download the plugin and readme file to a folder in your Downloads directory called "old-vera-plugin". Once it's downloaded just open that folder and double-click on the "MiCasaVerdeVera.indigoPlugin" file to have the client install and enable it for you.

We highly recommend that you **do not** use this plugin and the Vera Bridge plugin included with Indigo 6 at the same time - it could lead to out of sync device states and excess delays communicating with the Vera.

##Contributing

If you want to contribute, just clone the repository, make your changes, and issue a pull request. Make sure that you describe the change you're making thoroughly. 

##Terms

Perceptive Automation is hosting this repository and will do minimal management. Unless a pull request has no description or upon cursory observation has some obvious issue, pull requests will be accepted without any testing by us. We may choose to delegate commit privledges to other users at some point in the future.

We don't guarantee anything about this plugin - that this plugin works or does what the description above states, so use at your own risk.
